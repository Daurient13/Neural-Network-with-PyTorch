# Dataset
in this project I use tabular data like the previous machine learning project. This data is talking about Diabetes, data consists of 768 rows and 9 columns.
Here are the column variables.

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome

# Import Data

import data with pandas

# Explanation
# Quick Exploratory Data Analysis
unfortunately in PyTorch there is no preprocessor like in Scikit-Learn, because this is a tabular dataset, then in PyTorch still use Scikit-Learn, but if you have entered image data, text data, unstructured data it is very good with PyTorch.

From the data above, there are several columns with missing values, 'Insulin' has a missing value of 48.70% which will be dropped from the column. While the other columns will be left as they are, including the 'SkinThickness' column which has a missing value of almost 30%

Then check whether the data is balanced. The percentage if we use the baseline accuracy is 65%, then this is not imbalanced data.

# Dataset Splitting
split the data into X, and y

X = all columns except the target column.

y = 'Outcome' as target

test_size = 0.2 (which means 80% for train, and 20% for test)

# Data Preprocessing
Just a reminder that in PyTorch there is no data preprocessor, so I still use Scikit-Learn
